    <h2 class="rhead">Description</h2>
    <p class="description">This chicken salad sandwich is the perfect addition to any picnic.  It has a great combination of sweet and salty flavors and is easy to make, requiring very few ingredients.</p>
    <p>I learned this recipe from one of my first ever roommates after graduating high school - Martha Sue Dilbeck.  She was a terrible roommate and went on to steal quite a lot of money from me, but to this day I sure do love her chicken salad.</p>
    <h2 class="rhead">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of chunked chicken in water</li>
        <li>a big dollop of mayonaise (Miracle whip works too, if you're a monster.)</li>
        <li>1 packet of powdered ranch dressing mix</li>
        <li>green grapes cut in half, as many as you want</li>
        <li>note: Sometimes I like to add some chopped pecans, too.</li>
        <li>bread - Croissants work nicely, but most any bread will do.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="rhead">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all your ingredients, except the bread, because that's not how sandwiches work.</li>
        <li>Put the chicken salad between two slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Shout, "F*** you, Martha Sue!"</li>
        <li>Eat and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
