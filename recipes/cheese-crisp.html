    <h2 class="rhead">Description</h2>
    <p>Remember when you were a kid and the only thing you wanted to eat was carbs and cheese?  Behold!  The classic cheese crisp!  You'll find that as adults we want to complicate this recipe by adding all kinds of extra veggies and protiens.  I say, stick with the classic.  It's simple and delicious and will fill your belly even if it is devoid of just about any nutritional value.</p>
    <h2 class="rhead">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tortilla</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
        <li>Why are you looking for a third ingredient??  I told you not to complicate things!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="rhead">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your tortilla on a microwave safe plate.</li>
        <li>Generously sprinkle cheese over half the tortilla.</li>
        <li>Fold the tortilla in half over the cheese and smush it down in hopes that it will stay folded.</li>
        <li>Microwave until cheese is melted, probably about 33 seconds.</li>
        <li>Note: It tastes <em>way</em> better if you prepare it on a griddle or on the stovetop, but then would it really be the classic one you ate as a kid?</li>
    </ol>
