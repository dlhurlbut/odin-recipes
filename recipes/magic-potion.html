    <h2 class="rhead">Description</h2>
    <p>Listen, sometimes we all wake up with that bit of sore throat that isn't dire enough to miss work or go to the doctor over, but still really sucks.  After years of people recommending many different rememdies to me, I discovered that the most surefire bet was to use them all at once.  It's not gentle, by any means, but if you're willing to push through the process of drinking it, it always does the trick.</p>
